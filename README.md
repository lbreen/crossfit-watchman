### Who are we?

CrossFit Watchman is a military affiliate based in Episkopi Garrison, in the Western Sovereign Base Area.

The affiliate will provide an opportunity for personnel to follow the CrossFit training methodology, and aims to attract novice and experienced athletes in equal measure.

Developing a community of likeminded people, who can share experiences outside of the gym, is as much of an aspiration of the affiliate as developing the health and fitness of our members.
